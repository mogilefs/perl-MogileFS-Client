1.09 - 2009-10-16

        * Change really misleading timeout error message.

        * Add optional startpos argument to fsck_reset.

        * Add experimental 'edit_file' command, making use of ClientHTTPFile.

        * Add 'read_file' command, which returns a seekable filehandle
        to a mogile key, making use of ClientHTTPFile.

        * Add new ClientHTTPFile backend as an alternate to NewHTTPFile.
        This is used if the 'largefile' option is passed to new_file.

1.08 - 2007-08-06

        * Include update_device command for consistency.

        * Include 'clear_cache' command.

        * updated docs

        * add fsck mgmt/status/querying commands to MogileFS::Admin

1.05 - 2007-04-16

        * POD docs!

        * Add create_open_args and create_close_args which can be passed to
          new_file (plus store_file and store_content). This can be used to
          pass extra information to plugins running in the tracker.

1.04 - Mar 26, 2007

        * add observed_state and I/O utiliz% columns to mogadm check.

        * removed support for non-http:// storage node URLs.  that is,
          "NFS mode" is now gone.  yay.  it always sucked.

1.03 - Sep 25, 2006

        * rename from MogileFS to MogileFS::Client, add POD, prep for
          future work.

        * more verbose error messages

        * AUTOLOAD-proxy unknown methods to server for server-based
          plugins (Mark Smith)

        * Andreas J. Koenig <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>:
          The following bugfix guards against externally influenced $/. In
          our case, somebody (not @danga :) had set $/ to undef and so the
          application was hanging forever.

1.01 - Jan 10, 2005

        * fix CPU spinning bug in _getline where we didn't handle
          sysread() returning 0.  (Brad)
